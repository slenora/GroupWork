% Downloading data from NASA GES DISC can be frusterating. Here is a code
% to help figure out what links are missing and that need to be downloaded.
% Recommend that you use Google Chrome Extension, Simple Mass Downloader.
% It has the option of downloading link imported from a file. As of now,
% Firefox's similiar extension does not have that capability

files = dir('Z:\Stephania\NLDAS\Precip\hydro1.gesdisc.eosdis.nasa.gov\daac-bin\OTF\*.nc4'); %This is your "mini-directory of all the nc4 files. Make sure you change this appropriately

len = 45288; %how many files ou should have between two dates of your download, including hours (1,887 days x 24 hours)

%run in command window
%files(1).name (beginning period)
%files(len).name (end period)

t1=datetime(2012,11,01,0,0,0); % This is beginning of files in year, month, day, hour, minute, second. Minutes and Seconds are 0 (zero) always
t2=datetime(2017,12,31,23,0,0); % This is end of files in year, month, day, hour, minute, second. Minutes and Seconds are 0 (zero) always
z=linspace(t1,t2,len); % this is a structure creates a datetime object that corresponds with the YYYY, MM, DD, HH of each file

%Check your z variable, it should look something like this...
%01-Nov-2012 00:00:00
%01-Nov-2012 01:00:00
%01-Nov-2012 02:00:00
%...
% there should be no minutes and seconds other than 00:00
% if you have minutes and seconds, you either have a file missing or
% duplicated. 


z=z'; %This is to flip it

z1 = datevec(z);%This is to convert datetime to a vector containing X number of rows with, year, month, day, hour, minute, second
z1(:,5:6) = []; %this is to delete the columns corresponding with minutes and seconds since our data has only hourly resolution

table1 = struct2table(files);
table1(:,2:6) = [];

writetable(table1,'TestDates.csv')

%% Which files are missing?

%you have to manipulate the data in excel, to get just the year, month,
%day, and hour, using text to columns and fixed width

dates_N = csvread('TestDates.csv');

[ia, ib] = setdiff(z1, dates_N,'rows');

[C, ic, id] = intersect(z1,dates_N,'rows');

%% Create txt file for missing data

%open precip_1.txt using importdata tool. This is the full txt file
%cntaining the subset data that your ordered for your whole time period.
%This should not be changed. After you import it as a table, save it as a
%matlab variable that you will upload multiple times.

load('precip1.mat') % the original table containing the links you loaded

precip1(ic,:) = []; % this gets rid of all the links that are the same as the ones you already have downloaded. 

writetable(precip1,'missingData.txt') % this is the new file containing missing URL links



%% Test Duplicates

files2 = dir('Z:\Stephania\NLDAS\Precip\hydro1.gesdisc.eosdis.nasa.gov\daac-bin\OTF\*(1).nc4');
